# KPoolManager
Object pooling for unity games. Have a reference to the pool manager in the scene and use .Clone(Prefab Transform) for cloning and use .Free(Transform) for freeing clones. More juicy documentation will be released later. I developed this on top of 2020.3.3f1 but I believe you can use version!
